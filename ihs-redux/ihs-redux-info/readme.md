This folder contains a HubL template (reduxInfo.html) that sets a HubL variable (**reduxInfo**). This variable is automatically generated by a GitHub action (**create-redux-info-file.yaml**) that runs a NodeJs app (**gen-redux-info.js**). The app starts on push event on main branch and scans the ihs-redux directory in the repository, create and commit the reduxInfo.html file. When completed, it triggers **deploy-redux-info-to-hs.yaml** in order to copy the redux info file to HubSpot developer file system.

# IMPORTANT!!!
**Do not remove this readme.md file from folder, gitHub action may raise errors when creating the redux info file.**
